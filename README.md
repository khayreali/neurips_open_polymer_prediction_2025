This notebook implements a solution for the NEURIPS 2025 Open Polymer Prediction competition, predicting five physical properties of polymers (Glass Transition Temperature, Fractional Free Volume, Crystallization Temperature, Density, and Radius of Gyration) from their SMILES molecular representations. The approach combines traditional machine learning with deep learning, using a stacked ensemble of XGBoost and Random Forest models trained on RDKit-derived molecular descriptors and Morgan/MACCS fingerprints, alongside a pre-trained Graph Attention Network (GNN) that learns from molecular graph structures. The pipeline augments the training data with external polymer datasets, performs feature engineering including Mordred descriptors, trains separate models for each target property using 5-fold cross-validation, and finally combines predictions through a meta-model (XGBoost) that learns optimal weights between the tree-based and GNN predictions. This hybrid approach leverages both traditional cheminformatics features and graph-based representations to capture different aspects of polymer structure-property relationships.
